                <h2>Application Development</h2>
                <p>Developing and designing a mobile application have always been my career goal. I've been using social media applications such as instagram, facebook and snapchat for years now and I've seen them changing their design from year to year. Now it would be awesome if I had the oportunity to collaborate with a team and design one of those apps! This, for sure, is a dream career goal of mine, but achieving that goal will first mean developing and designing my own app. Therefore, if interested in collaboration, please get in touch with me below or from the contact page. </p>

                <p>Gaming is one of passion. I've been playing mobile and pc games for years now and I've always wondered if one day I will design a game. Now, with the knowledge gained so far and still progressing, it is finally becoming a realistic dream. Anybody thinking about collaborating and developing and designing a game, please now that I am available and will not let anyone down. I'm currently thinking about making a adventure/rpg game and if anybody interested, please take a look at the contact page.</p>
